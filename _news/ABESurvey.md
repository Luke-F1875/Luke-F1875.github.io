Our article, "[Towards a Cryptography Encyclopedia: A Survey on Attribute-based Encryption](https://www.oaepublish.com/articles/jsss.2023.30?utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=email&utm_source=sendgrid.com)", has been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Surveillance, Security and Safety. Dive into our survey, where we construct a sub-encyclopedia dedicated to Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) schemesâ€”a crucial component in digital business models, particularly in domains like streaming. Our work provides a comprehensive overview, taxonomy, and performance evaluation of 42 ABE schemes. By bridging the gap for developers, we envision a cryptography encyclopedia that simplifies the process of selecting the most suitable encryption schemes for various applications.
