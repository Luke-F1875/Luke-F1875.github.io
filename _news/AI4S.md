Our paper, "[Tournament-Based Pretraining to Accelerate Federated Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3624062.3626089)", has been accepted for presentation at the 4th ACM International Workshops on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Scientific Applications ([AI4S](https://ai4s.github.io)). In this work, we introduce three innovative variants of a serverless federated learning framework, specifically addressing challenges associated with leveraging edge data. We introduce tournament-based pretraining that significantly enhances model performance. With these federated learning advancements, we aim to enable researchers to move beyond hurdles and focus on advancing scientific applications.
