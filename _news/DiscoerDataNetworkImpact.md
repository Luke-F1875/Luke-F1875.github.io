Our article, "[Network impact analysis on the performance of Secure Group Communication schemes with focus on IoT](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44248-024-00015-1)", has been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Discover Data. Secure and scalable group communication is vital for IoT applications like smart cities and healthcare, especially in Wireless Sensor Networks with low-capacity sensors. Choosing the right Secure Group Communication (SGC) scheme is tough due to varied options. While past research focused on server/client runtimes, we are the first to analyze network-based performance. Using ComBench, we tested SKDC, LKH (centralized), and G-DH (decentralized) schemes under different network conditions. Our findings? Packet loss and delay significantly affect execution times, more so than group size.
