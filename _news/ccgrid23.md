Our paper, "[An Empirical Study of Container Image Configurations and Their Impact on Start Times](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10171550)," just accepted at the 23rd IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Internet Computing ([CCGRID](https://ccgrid2023.iisc.ac.in)), delves into an analysis of 200,000 open-source Docker Hub images. Through this extensive examination, we discovered that container start times exhibit a broad range—from milliseconds to seconds—even within the same environment. Notably, our findings reveal that no single dominant configuration feature decisively determines a container's start time.
