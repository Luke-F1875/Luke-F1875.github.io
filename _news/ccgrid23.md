Our research paper "[An Empirical Study of Container Image Configurations and Their Impact on Start Times](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10171550)" was accepted at the 23rd IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing  ([CCGRID](https://ccgrid2023.iisc.ac.in)).

We analyzed 200,000 open-source Docker Hub images to understand how configurations impact container start times. Results? Start times vary widely (ms to seconds) in the same environment & no single dominant configuration feature determines a container's start time!
