Our article, "[A literature review of IoT and CPS - What they are, and what they are not](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0164121223000262)", has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Systems & Software. It investigates whether terms like Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, and others are merely buzzwords or meaningful concepts. By delving into the origins, conducting a comprehensive literature review, and providing precise definitions for IoT and CPS, our research aims to contribute clarity to these evolving fields.
