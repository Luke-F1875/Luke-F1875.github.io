Our journal paper "[A literature review of IoT and CPS - What they are, and what they are not](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0164121223000262)" was accepted at the Journal of Systems & Software for publication.


Are Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, and others just buzzwords or meaningful concepts? Our paper delves deep, tracing the origins, reviewing literature, and presenting clear definitions for IoT and CPS.
