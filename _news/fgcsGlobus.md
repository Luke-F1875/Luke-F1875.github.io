Our article, "[The Globus Compute Dataset: An Open Function-as-a-Service Dataset From the Edge to the Cloud](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2023.12.007)", has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Future Generation Computer Systems. Delve into the world of federated function-as-a-service (FaaS) through our unique dataset from the Globus Compute platform. This dataset spans 31 weeks, capturing 2 million task submissions, 252 users, and 580 computing endpoints. Explore intriguing observations, from short task runtimes to the diverse use of endpoints. As the first federated FaaS dataset with user workloads, it will be a goldmine for research in FaaS architecture and distributed computing.
