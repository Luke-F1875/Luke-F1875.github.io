Our article, "[De Bello Homomorphico: Investigation of the extensibility of the OpenFHE library with basic mathematical functions by means of common approaches using the example of the CKKS cryptosystem](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00781-0)", has been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Information Security. In the context of the growing number of IoT devices and the associated increased threat of cyber attacks, our study addresses the challenge of selecting the right Secure Group Communication (SGC) scheme. The comprehensive evaluation of 34 schemes, considering computational and communication costs along with security features, is presented. Our use of decision trees simplifies the selection process for centralized, distributed, and decentralized SGC schemes. Arm yourself with these insights for robust IoT security.
