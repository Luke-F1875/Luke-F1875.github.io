Our research paper, "[Autoscaler Evaluation and Configuration: A Practitioner's Guideline](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3578244.3583721)," has been accepted for presentation at the 14th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering ([ICPE](https://icpe2023.spec.org/)). In this study, we address the intriguing question of how autoscaler setup influences both the quality and cost of cloud applications. Our paper offers valuable insights, presenting practical guidelines for autoscaler performance evaluation. With step-by-step instructions, realistic usage behaviors, and considerations for various traffic patterns, our research provides a comprehensive resource for practitioners navigating the challenges of autoscaler configuration.
