Our paper, "[A Systematic Approach for Benchmarking of Container Orchestration Frameworks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3578244.3583726)", has been accepted for presentation at the 14th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering ([ICPE](https://icpe2023.spec.org/)). In this latest work, we introduce COFFEE, a benchmarking approach designed specifically for container orchestrators. Recognizing the critical importance of assessing performance in this domain, our paper addresses the lack of a comprehensive approach until now. We systematically define requirements, link them to metrics, and propose a benchmark architecture.
