Our research paper, "[Efficient Data Processing: Assessing the Performance of Different Programming Languages](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3578245.3584691)", has been accepted for presentation at the 14th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering ([ICPE](https://icpe2023.spec.org/)). In this study, we delve into the intriguing realm of data processing, specifically comparing the performance of R, Python, and Rust in various tasks. Our paper presents the results of comprehensive benchmarks implemented in each language, revealing significant performance gaps. Surprisingly, even identical code exhibits variations based on the interpreter used. While Rust and Python showcase strong performance, R lags behind in the assessed data tasks.
