Our workshop paper, "[Performance Impact Analysis of Homomorphic Encryption: A Case Study Using Linear Regression as an Example](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-7032-2_17)", has been accepted for presentation at the 18th International Conference on Information Security Practice and Experience ([ISPEC](https://ispec2023.compute.dtu.dk/index.html)). In this study, we delve into the performance of homomorphic encryption through real-world applications of linear regression. The verdict? While homomorphic linear regression takes minutes, slower than its non-homomorphic counterpart, it stands out for its security features.
