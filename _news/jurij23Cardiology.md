Our article, "[Impact of Prophylactic Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump on Early Outcomes in Patients With Severe Left Ventricular Dysfunction Undergoing Elective Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting With Cardiopulmonary Bypass](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527323007258)", has been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Cardiology. In our study, we thoroughly investigated the use of prophylactic intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction. The results are conclusive: there is a notable reduction in postoperative low cardiac output syndrome, a lower requirement for support, and no increase in in-hospital mortality. The use of prophylactic IABP emerges as a beneficial strategy for improving outcomes in high-risk cardiac procedures.
