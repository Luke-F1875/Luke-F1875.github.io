Our research paper, "Octopus: Experiences with a Hybrid Event-Driven Architecture for Distributed Scientific Computing", has been accepted for presentation at the International Workshop on Fault Tolerance for HPC at eXtreme Scale ([FTXS](https://sites.google.com/site/ftxsworkshop/)). Scientific research increasingly depends on distributed resources from HPC and cloud systems to edge devices. Event-driven architecture (EDA) enhances applications targeting these infrastructures by managing communication, processing, and security of distributed events. Enter Octopusâ€”a hybrid cloud-to-edge event fabric designed to scale with demand, enable resilient applications, and enforce fine-grained access control. Supporting up to 9.6M events/second, Octopus is tailored for use cases like self-driving labs, data automation, and dynamic workflows.
