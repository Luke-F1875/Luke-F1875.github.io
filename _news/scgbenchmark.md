Our article, "[Benchmarking of Secure Group Communication schemes with focus on IoT](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44248-024-00010-6)", has been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Discover Data. With the proliferation of IoT devices comes an increase in cybersecurity threats. Unlike standard 1-to-1 communication, IoT requires efficient n-to-n encryption, which is achieved through Secure Group Communication schemes. However, the abundance of available schemes makes selecting the right one daunting. Our paper addresses this challenge by presenting a benchmark specifically tailored for IoT, assisting developers in their scheme selection process. We define business problems, design a specification-based benchmark, and extend it to a hybrid benchmark suitable for real-world IoT environments.
