Our journal paper, "[Recommendation of Secure Group Communication Schemes Using Multi-objective Optimization](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10207-023-00692-0)", has been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Information Security. This study addresses the challenge of choosing the appropriate Secure Group Communication (SGC) scheme. We systematically evaluate 34 schemes, analyzing computational and communication costs along with security features. Utilizing decision trees, we streamline the selection process for centralized, distributed, and decentralized SGC schemes.
