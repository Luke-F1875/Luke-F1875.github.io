I am a computer scientist working as a postdoctoral scholar at [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/) led by Prof. Ian Foster in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago since November 2022. I am also the founder and elected chair of the [SPEC RG Predictive Data Analytics Working Group](https://research.spec.org/working-groups/rg-predictive-data-analytics/).

In a nutshell, my research objective is the application of data science across disciplines and domains. To this end, I address the challenges of data analytics clouds from performance engineering, sustainability, and data analytics perspectives. More precisely, my research vision encompasses the following three main pillars:
* Improvement of data analytics methods as well as their infrastructure (i.e., improve performance).
* Development of an automated framework to streamline the data analytics task (i.e., improve usability).
* Raise awareness and support for sustainable data analytics (i.e., improve energy efficiency).

In general, my research interest lies in, but is not limited to:
* Data management: The focus is on FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data management and the promotion of publicly available research data.
* Data privacy: The idea here is to exchange data with third parties, preserving the privacy of the data. I am interested in synthetic data generation and homomorphic encryption.
* Data analytic clouds: I am interested in the development, autonomous management (i.e., autonomous scaling of resources), benchmarking of various building blocks of such clouds, and runtime prediction and scheduling of data analytic tasks.
* Data analytics: My focus is on data analytics, clustering, and imputation. I am also interested in benchmarking and developing data analytics methods. In addition, I work on the application of such methods in interdisciplinary projects.
* Sustainable data science: Specifically, this involves the development of an energy efficiency benchmark for Deep and Machine Learning.
